# Dijkstra-s-Root-And-Cost-Finder
//for n inputs in a array
//1st input--> no. of node # no. of edge
//rest n-1 inputs--> From Node # To Node # Cost
//Output --> All Path from Initial node to Final node and it's respective cost.


*for output cases--
 //take root1 array--> for all roots
//take cost1 array-->for cost to those roots;
//take toller array--> to Insert toll between roots
* BY DEFAULT--> its will show root
* for Differnt output- Change input1.
* NOTE- DONOT put circular root/loop
*
